                <div style="margin-top:3%; text-align:justify;">              
					<p> I am currently a full-time research assistant at IIT Madras under <a href = 'https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/'>Dr. Mitesh Khapra</a> and <a href = 'http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~pratyush/'>Dr. Pratyush Kumar</a>. In the past I have also worked under <a href = 'http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/'>Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at IIIT, Delhi as a research intern.</p> 
					
					<p> Still being at the initial stages of learning, I am far from converging to a global minima of precise and concrete research interests. However, the idea of teaching machines to read, write and in turn understand our world - textually, visually, physically, and socially - stimulates me.</p>
					
          <p> Since the past year, I have picked up a crucial problem of social biases in word representations as "The Endurance" to explore the vast field of natural language processing. Daring into the uncharted territories, I have managed to find many new insights and some solutions to the problem, presented as research papers and open source tools.</p>
          
          <p> On my voyage, I have been amazed by the dominance of current language models, but have also witnessed its brittleness and a sheer lack of true understanding about the world. Surveying various works I have realized the importance of making models more interpretable and robust. Additionally, moving in the direction of learning representations for language through grounding,  and exploring linguistically informed inductive biases. Thus, I look forward to working on these sub-domains of NLP in the future.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>FEE is an open-source library for the analysis of gender bias in word embeddings.
            It combines various state of the art techniques for quantifying, visualising and mitigating gender bias in 
            word embeddings under a standard abstraction.</li>
            <li>Its design aids practitioners in fast track analysis of existing debiasing
            methods on their embedding models, and also allows rapid prototyping of new methods by evaluating their 
            performance on a suite of standard metrics. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul> <li>A collection of three types of RNN or attention based sequence to sequence models with increasing complexity and performance. The models are trained and tested for machine translation. <br>
              1) Seq2SeqExample - Multi-layer LSTM based Encoder-Decoder. <br>
              2) Seq2SeqPR - Context Vector dependent GRU based Encoder-Decoder. <br>
              3) Seq2SeqAttention - Attention dependent GRU based Encoder-Decoder. <br></li>

            <a href = "https://github.com/10-zin/Synthesizer">A PyTorch implementation of the paper - " SYNTHESIZER: Rethinking Self-Attention in Transformer Models"</a>
            <ul> 
              <li>Transformers have become pervasive and they are powered by the fundamental scaled dot product attention mechanism. But are they necessary? </li>
              <li>This paper majorly introduced two alternate forms of attentions:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Dense Attention + Its factorized version
                  </li>
                  <li>Random Attention + Its factorized version</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The authors of the paper have not yet released their code, but being shocked by the fact that thier Random Attention Model performed comparably with standard attention mechnainsm, I just couldn't resist.</li>
              <li>Thus, this project. My results (tho at a lower scale due to lack of compute) convey the same too.</li>
              <li>The project's README is under construction as of now, as I am busy attentding EMNLP, but I will publicise the code ASAP.</li>
